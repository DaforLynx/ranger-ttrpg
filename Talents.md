I've separated talents into "out of combat" and "in combat" talents just to make things easier to browse through, but these categories do not necessarily dictate entirely when a talent can be used or when it is relevant.
There's also a category for magical abilities. Magic is an optional system which is up to the Narrator to allow.
# Out of combat
**Bean Hoarder** (1 RP)
Somehow, you seem to always have access to precious coffee beans to keep you and fellow Rangers sated. Even when by all rights you should have run out. If you run out of coffee and must make some, roll a MIND check to determine whether you have more on you.
**Caffeine Free** (1 RP)
You have been gifted with the lack of a caffeine addiction. You never suffer the effects of coffee withdrawal, but neither do you gain a Caffeine Rush by drinking it.
**Voice of Reason** (1 RP)
You have advantage on WIT checks to deescalate a situation or persuade a party for peace.
**Spectre of Death** (1 RP)
You have advantage on WIT checks to intimidate a person or group of people into submission.
**Diplomat** (1 RP)
You have advantage on WIT checks to negotiate with an organization. You can also glean deeper information and intent when reading through legal documents such as treaties and contracts.
**Back Never Turned** (2 RP)
Your WIT score is doubled when considering your vigilance against stealthing characters.
**Wilderness Expert** (2 RP)
MIND checks made as the party's expedition leader for wilderness travel and navigation are made at advantage.
**To the Ends of the Earth** (2 RP)
MIND checks made to track a target are made at advantage.
# In combat
**Quick Fingered** (1 RP)
Picking up an object or weapon doesn't require an action as long as you didn't drop it on the same turn. Additionally, picking locks and other involved tasks using manual dexterity only use one action.
**Herbalist** (1 RP)
You have access to enough herbs to revive one Ranger per mission. These herbs are powerful enough to be administered in one action and take effect immediately.
**Trippy** (1 RP)
When dealing 1 or more damage with a CQC attack, a player can roll a BODY check which knocks the opponent prone on success.
**Adrenaline Rush** (1 RP)
When an enemy attempts to attack you, whether or not it hits, you can choose to immediately use a move action or attack back without affecting the action count of your next turn. This talent can be used a number of times per day equal to 1 + your BODY stat.
**Born Ready** (2 RP)
Stringing a bow only takes one action. Characters who surprise attack you receive no bonus to their attack roll. You can use one Caffeine Rush to immediately attack a character that has attacked you without any action loss.
**The Capsule** (2 RP)
You have obtained and been trained on an experimental piece of equipment: a tiny capsule which can be hidden in a tooth, containing a certain powdered concoction which can be released onto the tongue in a dire circumstance. The powder does NOT kill you. Once per mission, if you fall unconscious, you will be revived without assistance on your next turn at 1 hitpoint.
**Sharpshooter** (2 RP)
You can use your bow at extreme range without suffering disadvantage due to range.
**Swordmaster** (2 RP)
Your CQC weapon is replaced with a sword. It uses 1d8+1 for its roll and requires two hands to wield.
**Quickdraw** (2 RP)
*Prerequisite: Swordmaster*
In one fluid motion, you put away your bow, draw your sword, and attack with it. You can stow your bow as part of a CQC attack action.
**Handheld Ballista** (2 RP)
Your bow is replaced with a two-handed crossbow. It uses 1d8-1 for its roll and pierces normal armor, dealing full damage, but requires an action to load each bolt. The attack can be a critical failure, resulting in loading taking two actions in a single turn instead.
**Uncrossed Wires** (2 RP)
*Prerequisite: Handheld Ballista*
You no longer suffer from critical failures using your crossbow. Your crossbow uses 1d8 for its roll and can pierce through all armor including that of heavily armored targets, dealing full damage.
**Strange Ways** (2 RP)
Your throwing knife is replaced by three shurikens or kunai. These use 1d8 for their roll.
**You're It** (2 RP)
*Prerequisite: Strange Ways*
You can choose to attach an exploding tag to your shurikens/kunai as part of their attack action. This explosion happens immediately after your turn and deals an extra 1d8 damage to targets within short range of the initial target (including that initial target), blinding them until their next turn.
**Keen Eye** (2 RP)
Spend both actions in a turn to look for a weakness in an enemy's armor. Roll a MIND check. On a success, all your subsequent attacks will bypass that enemy's armor completely, *including heavily armored ones*.
**The Crammer** (2 RP)
*Prerequisite: Keen Eye*
When you succeed a Keen Eye check, you also glean all their stats including armor, current+max hitpoints, and boss stats if they are a boss.
# Magic
**Listen to the Wind** (5 RP)
You can meditate for several minutes, at the end of which you can ascertain which direction a person or creature you have seen or heard lies in relation to you.
**Command Earth** (5 RP)
Once per turn, if you see a person moving over natural terrain, you can cause them to trip and fall prone at any point along their path.
**Forecast** (5 RP)
Once per mission, no matter the conditions, you can make a prediction of imminent weather (choosing from clear, overcast, rain (snow if plausible), or storm) which will come true before the end of the day or night (depending on when the prediction is made).
**Friend of the Nature-Folk** (5 RP)
Once per day, you can befriend and communicate to a non-hostile animal. You can only roughly understand their responses, and they are not obliged to follow any requests you make or commands you give.
