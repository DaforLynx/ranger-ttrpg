# What is this?
This is the source repository for a TTRPG I'm creating (title pending). It is heavily (heavily) inspired by the *Ranger's Apprentice* series by John Flanagan, but it is not necessarily rooted in that setting. This RPG is meant to be relatively simple, with a focus on tactics and on making travel at least a little engaging. That's not to say there aren't a whole lot of character-building options - just that, as a result of being focused on rangers, players will tend to fall into a similar archetype. The system itself is influenced by D&D 5e, Aurora RPG Engine, BOLT RPG, and probably others.
# How is this organized?
For now, there will be a main `Rulebook.md` alongside collections of talents, enemies, missions, adventures, and maybe even settings. There's also PDFs exported by my Obsidian software in the `PDFs` folder. They're not pretty, but they're better than trying to read the markdown. Eventually, I'll put together a proper PDF and release it for free here and on itch.io, but that's not going to happen for a while (if ever).
# How can I contribute?
This is a personal project, so I'm not taking feedback right now. PRs will be ignored. Feel free to playtest, and if you *really* want you can give me feedback by contacting me. I will also be playtesting in my own time.
